<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p align="justify">The major goal of this project is to create a system that will help animal researchers and photographers of wild animals deal with the numerous obstacles they face on a daily basis.</p>

<p align="justify">In order to determine whether a patient has heart disease, I've employed a range of Machine Learning algorithms that were developed in Python. This classification algorithm predicts whether or not cardiac disease is present by using a binary variable as the goal variable and a range of characteristics as the input features.</p>

* Building a **Flask App** hosted on **Heroku**.
* **Sklearn** for pre-processing and Model Building
* Pandas, Numpy for csv reading, Data Processing, Data Cleaning, Visualization etc.
* Machine Learning algorithms used: Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
